Description: 
    A pedagogically oriented implementation of classical resampling and 
    randomization methods for Statistical Computing. The package includes 
    from-scratch implementations of the bootstrap (SE, bias, and CIs), 
    jackknife, permutation tests, K-fold and leave-one-out cross-validation, 
    and Monte Carlo integration with variance reduction (antithetic variables, 
    control variates, importance sampling, and stratification). 
    Designed for graduate-level courses in computational statistics.
